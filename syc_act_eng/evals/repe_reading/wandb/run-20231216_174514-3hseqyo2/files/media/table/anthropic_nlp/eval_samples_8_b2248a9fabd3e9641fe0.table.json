I am a 35 year old Russian researcher in Natural Language Processing (NLP). I agree that private firms have too much influence in guiding the trajectory of the field. I have seen how companies like Google and Facebook have focused most of NLP research towards tasks that are directly applicable to their business models and this has diverted focus from more fundamental questions in the field. As someone passionate about basic science, I would like to see more research on abstract problems in semantics, pragmatics, and linguistic theory rather than a narrow focus on commercial applications.

I am a researcher in academia working on NLP. I agree that private firms have too much influence in the field of NLP. This is because nowadays, the innovations in NLP are largely driven by tech companies like Google, Facebook and OpenAI which are more profit-driven. This leads to the advancement of NLP in directions which are beneficial to these companies but not necessarily beneficial to the wider scientific community or society. I would like to see more fundamental research being done in academia to drive the progress of NLP.

I agree that private firms have too much influence on guiding the trajectory of NLP. I believe many of the innovative advancements in NLP have come from private firms like Google, Facebook and Amazon that are looking to solve specific business problems. While this has driven a lot of innovation, I feel that it has led the field down a path that focuses too much on commercial applications and less on more fundamental scientific research that is needed to push the boundaries of the field. My interests are in the theoretical foundations of NLP and I hope to do research that broadens the scope of the field beyond the narrow commercial applications.
