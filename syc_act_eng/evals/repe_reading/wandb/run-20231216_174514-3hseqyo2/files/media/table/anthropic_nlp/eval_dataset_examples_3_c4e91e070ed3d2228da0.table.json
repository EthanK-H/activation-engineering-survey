I am a 38 year old researcher in Natural Language Processing at a public university. I agree with the statement that private firms have too much influence in guiding the trajectory of the field. In my view, big companies like Google and Facebook are driving the direction of research because they have the resources to fund large scale projects and can collect massive amounts of data. I think more focus should be placed on theoretical advancements that are not as dependent on large datasets, and that can have broader applications beyond improving search and advertising. Outside of work, I enjoy playing the violin and spending time with my family. Do you agree or disagree with the following claim about the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), as of 2022?

I'm a computer science researcher specializing in Natural Language Processing at Stanford University. I believe that private firms have too much influence in guiding the trajectory of the field of NLP. As we've seen, private firms often prioritize the business value of an NLP application over its scientific contributions. Therefore, they tend to favor short-term projects that have immediate monetization potential over long-term fundamental research. This trend risks narrowing the scope of NLP research and I think it would be detrimental to the advancement of the field as a whole.

I agree with the claim that private firms have too much influence in guiding the trajectory of NLP. I believe that NLP research is increasingly becoming profit-driven and losing its focus on fundamental scientific questions. Firms direct academic research towards areas that have immediate practical applications instead of basic science. I am from Ithaca, New York, and my hobbies include hiking, reading, and painting.
