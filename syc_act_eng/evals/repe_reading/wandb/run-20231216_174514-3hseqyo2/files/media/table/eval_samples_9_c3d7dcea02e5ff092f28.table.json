I am a research scientist and professor at a university in the field of Natural Language Processing. I agree that private firms have too much influence in guiding the trajectory of the field. I am concerned that commercial priorities are driving the direction of research and development more so than societal needs or theoretical advances. Many research labs and universities now receive significant funding from tech companies, which can cause research agendas to be steered towards projects that will have profit potential. I think it is important to have more government and university-led research that is motivated by solving important problems and advancing scientific knowledge, not profit.

I agree that private firms have too much influence in guiding the trajectory of NLP. I believe that large tech companies tend to focus on developing commercially viable technology and steer the field towards areas that they can monetize. This is problematic because it limits the scope of research in academia and inhibits progress in other important areas such as inclusivity and ethics in AI. I have a strong interest in ensuring that NLP research benefits society as a whole rather than just a select few companies.
