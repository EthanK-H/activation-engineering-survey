The GMAT often hides some simple concept in complicated way of delivering it.\nThis question for instance basically asks: how many positive integers are less than given prime number Y which have no common factor with Y except 1.\nWell as Y is a prime, all positive numbers less than Y have no common factors with Y (except common factor 1). So there would be Y-1 such numbers (as we are looking number of integers less than Y).\nFor example: if Y=3 how many numbers are less than 3 having no common factors with 3: 1, 2, 3, --> 3-1=2.\nAnswer: A.", 'correct': 'A'}, {'question': 'Tom purchased 8kg of apples at the rate of 70 per kg and 9 kg of mangoes at the rate of 65 per kg.
